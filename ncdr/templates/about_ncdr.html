          <h3 class="subheader">Who are Data Services?</h3>
          <p>
            The NCDR Reference Library is owned and managed by the Data Services
            team. Data Services was established by NHS England to ensure that
            information about the performance and impact of NHS services is available
            when decisions are made about the commissioning of health services. Data
            Services also ensures that information has been accessed legally in accordance
            with all applicable laws and mandatory guidance contained within the Health
            and Social Care Act 2012, the Care Act 2014 and the European Union General
            Data Protection Regulations 2018 (GDPR).
          </p>
          <p>
            Data Services provides information to analysts working for NHS England in the
            form of data warehouses and packages of specific sets of data. The packages of data
            we produce enables analysts to provide evidence in the form of reports and
            dashboards to support the NHS drive to improve health and wellbeing across England.

              the need arises.
